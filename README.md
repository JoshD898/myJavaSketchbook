# MySketchApp

This is a Java app I developed during my CPSC 210 class. It uses the Java Swing library to allow users to create and view drawings (represented as rectangles) in their own art gallery.

### ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**
This project is actively being worked on! I'm focusing on adding several new features to improve my Java proficiency, including a cloud-based database, user authentication, and improving the GUI that allows for real drawings. Check back later!
