# CPSC 210 Project - Simple Art Gallery

### Project Description

The application will function as a basic art gallery. Users will be able to create and edit drawings, then publish those drawings to their personal gallery. The intended audience is people interested in experimenting with digital art.

This project interests me because I enjoy drawing, and I believe it will be a great way to improve my Java skills.

*Note: I think that implementing an interface that allows users to draw may be beyond the scope of this project. I may attempt it, but initially, I will simplify the process by representing a "drawing" as a rectangle. Users will be able to modify the color and size of the rectangle.*

### Phase 1 User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to add a drawing to my gallery while specifying the title, color and shape.
- As a user, I want to be able to change a drawing status one-directionally from *in progress* to *complete*.
- As a user, I want to be able to edit drawings that are *in progress*.
- As a user, I want to be able to remove drawings from my gallery.
- As a user, I want to be able to view all drawings in my gallery, and also filter by drawing status.
- As a user, I want to be able to see a summary of the number of drawings in my gallery, including a breakdown by project status.

### Phase 2 User Stories:
- As a user, I want to have the option to save my current gallery to file when I quit the application.
- As a user, I want to be able to load, save and delete multiple save files.

### Phase 3 User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to load and save the state of the application from the GUI.
- As a user, I want to be able to view, add, edit and delete my gallery drawings from the GUI.
